abstract = "A recent study claimed to have obtained evidence that participants can solve invisible multi-step arithmetic equations (Sklar et al., 2012). The authors used a priming paradigm in which reaction times to targets congruent with the equationâ€™s solution were responded to faster compared to incongruent ones. Here we critically reanalyze the data set of Sklar et al. and show that the claims being made in the article are not fully supported by the alternative analyses we apply. A Bayesian reanalysis of the data accounting for the random variability of the target stimuli in addition to the subjects shows that the evidence for priming effects is less strong than initially claimed. That is, although Bayes factors revealed evidence for the presence of a priming effect, it was generally weak. Second, the claim that unconscious arithmetic occurs for subtraction but not for addition is not supported when the critical interaction is tested. Third, the data show no sign of genuine number processing as derived from V-shaped response time curves for prime-target distances. Fourth, we show that it is impossible to classify reaction times as resulting from congruent or incongruent prime-target relationships, which should be expected if their results imply that participants genuinely solve the equations on each trial. In sum, we conclude that the claims being made in the original article are not fully supported by the analyses we apply here. Together with a recent failure to replicate the original results and a critique of the analysis based on regression to the mean, we argue that the current evidence for unconscious arithmetic is inconclusive. We argue that strong claims require strong evidence, and stress that cumulative research strategies are needed to provide such evidence."
