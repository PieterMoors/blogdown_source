# About me

I am postdoctoral researcher at the [GestaltReVision lab](http://www.gestaltrevision.be) at the KU Leuven. Currently, I study individual differences in perceptual organization. 

I obtained my PhD under the supervision of [Johan Wagemans](http://gestaltrevision.be/en/about-us/principal-investigator) and [Lee de-Wit](https://www.ice.cam.ac.uk/about-us/staff-profiles/tutor/dr-lee-de-wit) at the Laboratory of Experimental Psychology of the KU Leuven. My PhD research was focused on the relationship between perceptual organization and visual awareness. More specifically, the goal was to address which types of perceptual organization are still represented during binocular suppression. In my research, I have relied on continuous flash suppression to suppress visual input from visual awareness. You can find a copy of my dissertation [here](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/539852/1/dissertation_pietermoors.pdf).
